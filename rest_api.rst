REST API
===============
How to use
----------
A great way to send / receive rest API calls is with the [Postman extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en)

- set the url to http://IP_ADDRESS:port/COMMAND
- set correctly to either GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE
