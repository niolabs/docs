Getting Started
===============

.. _requirements:

Requirements
------------

* `Python 3.4 or greater <https://www.python.org/download/>`_
* `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_
* `virtualenv <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_
* `git <http://git-scm.com/download>`_

First, open a terminal in your home directory and check that you have everything you need.

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 --version
    pip3.4 --version
    virutalenv --version
    git --version

If those four commands don't return anything, then follow the requirement links before continuing.

For Windows
    Run the above commands in a **Git Bash** Terminal. To access this,
    make sure you select "Git Bash Here" when installing git. Then go to any folder and 
    ``right click`` -> ``Git Bash Here`` Before running the commands, you'll need to follow the directions for Windows  listed below.
    Also, be sure to pay attention to the **For Windows** notes throughout the tutorial.
    
    Sometimes the windows installation can be a pain. For help see (https://docs.python.org/3.4/using/windows.html).
    In the simplest case, you'll have to do the following:

    - Install Python3.4 for Windows from the link above
    - Go to ``Control Panel`` -> ``System`` -> ``Advanced System Settings`` -> ``Environment Variables``
        - In ``System variables`` select ``Path`` and hit ``Edit``
        - **Append** (do not delete any text that exists) the following text at the end of the line: ``;C:\Python34;C:\Python34\Scripts;``
        - hit ``OK`` until out of all configuration windows
    - **Create a** ``python3`` **shortcut to work with the rest of this tutorial** 
        *You may be able to skip this and just use* ``python`` *instead of* ``python3`` *for the rest of this tutorial*
   
    - Open ``cmd`` in Administrator Mode (``Windows Key`` -> locate ``command prompt`` -> right click ``command prompt`` -> ``Run as Administrator``
   
    - type: ``cd C:\Python34``
    
    - type: ``mklink python3.exe python.exe``
    
    **Pro Tip**: *After modifying anything in the system (such as all the actions from the above section), you'll need to close and re-open your git bash window to see your changes reflected. Simply close the window, right click, and select "git bash here" once more.*

    Congratulations, Windows users! Now you can verify your requirements are met by running the  4 commands shown above this section.

System Setup
------------

Each nio project will be in its own directory. We will start by creating some directories for these.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~
    mkdir nio
    cd nio
    mkdir projects
    mkdir versions

Global Installation (no virtual environment)
------------

Let's start by installing nio version 1.5.3 globally (without the use of a python virtual environment). In most cases, this is the method you will want to use. If you're installing n.io onto a device where you'll need the ability to switch between different versions for development/testing purposes, you may want to skip ahead to the intructions for installing with a **virtual environment**, but for almost all other cases, a global install is the way to go.

First we need to make sure the our user has the proper permissions to install python packages via ``pip``. This is done by adding our user to a group that has write permissions to ``/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages``. This group is usually ``staff`` on most linux distributions. The command to do this would be:

.. code-block:: bash
   
    sudo usermod -a -G staff <username>
    

Now we need to get the wheels for **nio** and **nioext** onto the device which n.io will be installed to. Once the wheels are on the device, navigate to the directory they have been copied to, and install them with these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip3.4 install nio-1.5.3-py3-none-any.whl
    sudo pip3.4 install nioext-1.5.3-py3-none-any.whl

**Note: Depending on how ``pip`` was installed, the command may be slightly different. You can verify the command to call pip by trying ``pip``, ``pip3``, or ``pip3.4`` with the ``--version`` option.



Virtual Environment Installation
------------
This section will guide you as to how n.io is installed contained within a python virtual environment. This keeps n.io and all it's dependencies isolated, and can be useful when you need the ability to switch between different versions of n.io, such as in a development or testing environment. You can read more about virtual environments `here <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/nio/versions
    virtualenv -p python3 1.5.3

For Windows
    The previous command will be: ``virtualenv -p C:/Python34/python.exe 1.5.3``

You now need to activate your virtual environment. This will add a `(1.5.3)` to the beginning of your command line to indicate the virtual environment that you are using.

.. code-block:: bash

    source 1.5.3/bin/activate

For Windows
    The previous command will be: ``source 1.5.3/Scripts/activate``

When you're done using nio, you can leave the virtual environment with ``deactivate``. When using nio again, be sure to activate the virtual environment first with ``source ~/nio/versions/1.5.3/bin/activate``.

OK, now we can install nio. If you don't have these wheels then you've got to make friends with someone who does!

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install nio-1.5.1-py3-none-any.whl
    pip install nioext-1.5.1-py3-none-any.whl

For Windows
    pywin32 must also be installed:
    
    ``easy_install http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/pywin32-219.win-amd64-py3.4.exe/download``
    
    *Note: make sure you take note of the "bittedness" of your python installation. The link above provides the command to install pywin32 on a system running 64-bit python. If you are running 32-bit python, the command will be:* 
   
    ``easy_install http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/pywin32-219.win32-py3.4.exe/download``

The installation of nio is now complete! You can run the instance from a project directory with the ``run_nio`` command. See :ref:`setting-up-a-project` for instructions on creating a project directory.

Installing nio CLI
------------------

We now install the **nio CLI**, a tool that takes care of common operations like creating projects, adding blocks, managing dependencies, and running n.io itself. It is called the nio Command Line Interface (CLI).

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install nio-cli

.. _setting-up-a-project:

Setting up a NIO Project
------------------------

To use the nio CLI you need `git` (a distributed version control tool) and a `GitHub account <http://github.com>` with `ssh access <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys>`.

To help you get started, we provide a `project template <https://github.com/nio-blocks/project_template>` which reflects the standard directory structure of a nio project. Use the nio CLI to create a new project from the template.

Verify that you can connect to git with: `ssh git@github.com`. It should return something like "Hi YOUR_USER_NAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."

For Windows
    If you have having trouble connecing, type this and then try again: ``eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa``

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/nio/projects
    nio new <project_name>
    cd <project_name>

If you don't have ssh access set up for GitHub then try using the https flags:

.. code-block:: bash

    nio new <project_name> --https
    
The first thing we're going to need is some blocks. We provide a selection of `open source blocks <https://github.com/nio-blocks>` for your convenience, but, remember, nio is designed to make it easy for you to develop custom blocks; more on this later. For now, let's just get a group of blocks that we've categorized as *util*.

.. code-block:: bash

    nio add util

Again, if you don't have ssh access set up for GitHub then try using the https flags:

.. code-block:: bash

    nio add util --https

Running nio
~~~~~~~~~~~

This part is simple. Navigate to your project directory (which you should still be in if you've been following along), and run the following command. If you've installed n.io to a virtual environment, make sure it's active!

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/nio/projects/<project_name>
    nio server

If you see any ERROR messages you may have a problem. But for now lets ignore this one: ``NIO [ERROR] [Discover] Failure loading module nioext.components.snmp.agent ImportError:No module named 'pysnmp'``. We won't be using that anyway.

The previous command runs n.io with standard output to the console. This is excellent to ensure that your instance is running properly and troubleshoot dependency issues, but for the most part, you'll want n.io running in the background. This is achieved by adding the ``-bg`` flag to the ``nio server`` command, like so: 

.. code-block:: bash

    nio server -bg
    
This method will simply return you to a command prompt, with no console message output, and will keep running until the instance is terminated with ``nio co shutdown``. 

At this point we're done running commands from the terminal, but we will be keeping an eye on these logs.

(Later, when you're done, you'll want to press ctrl-c to exit nio).

Creating your first service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

nio has a web app that you can use to interact with a running nio instance. By default, the `project_template` runs on **127.0.0.1:8181**, so just visit <http://builder.n.io> and log in with the default administrator priviledges (username: Admin; password: Admin). You should see something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    open http://builder.n.io

.. image:: files/blank_ui.png

To demonstrate the most basic use of the web UI, we'll design a service that generates nio signals automatically and logs them to the nio logging. With the way the `project template` is configured, this means we will see the simulated signals logged to the console and to a log file for our service.

First, click the **Add Service** button that appears in the top-right corner of the center panel of the web UI. Let's name the service `SimulateAndLog`. When you're done entering the service name, click **Submit**. At this point, your browser window should look something like this:

.. image:: files/sim_log_fresh.png

Now we can add a few blocks. The list in the left panel of the UI contains the list of block types currently loaded into nio. Scroll until you find the **Simulator**; click and drag it over to the `SimulateAndLog` grid. Name it `TestSimulator` and click **Submit**. In the left panel, again, scroll to find the **LoggerBlock**, and drag it over to the grid. Name it `TestLogger`.

Click **Save Service** in the bottom right of the right panel (you should get a confirmation that the save was successful).

.. image:: files/sim_log_config.png

Click the **Start Service** button in the very bottom right of the UI, and watch the terminal where you executed **run_nio**.

You should see a bunch of log messages with information about starting and configuring the service, but no signals get logged! This is because we didn't connect the blocks in `SimulateAndLog`. Nio blocks can run in isolation until the cows come home, but they won't communicate with each other until we explicitly connect them. Lets fix that.

First, stop the service (changes to a running service won't be reflected in its behavior until it is restarted anyway). Next, connect `TestSimulator` to `TestLogger`. Click and drag from the dot on the underside of `TestSimulator` to the dot on top of `TestLogger`.

.. image:: files/sim_log_connected.png

Click **Save Service** and **Start Service** again. This time you should see signals logged to the console every second (check the timestamps).

Congratulations! You just built your first nio service!

Configuring blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets try changing our service by configuring the blocks to something other than the default behavior.

Click on the `TestSimulator` block to bring up its configuration in the right panel. Don't worry too much about specific properties here. To get familiar though, scroll down to the `Interval` section and change the number in the `Seconds` text box from 1 to 2; click **Save Block**. Now select `TestLogger` in the execution grid and use the drop-down menu to change its `Log Level` and `Log At` to *DEBUG*, saving the block when you're done. 

Restart your service by clicking **Stop Service** and **Start Service**. This time you should see signals logged to the console every 2 seconds (check the timestamps).

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you've got a nio project with some blocks, try playing around with some of the other blocks. Change some more configuration settings on `TestLogger`. What does `Signal Count do`?. Try putting a **Counter** between a **Simulator** and a **Logger**. All the blocks have `documentation on GitHub <https://github.com/nio-blocks/util>`_.

When you're done with nio, go to the console where your logs are printing and press ctrl-c to exit nio.
